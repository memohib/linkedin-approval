The AI landscape is becoming increasingly competitive, with new startups challenging established players in the development of large language models (LLMs). According to recent benchmarks by LMSYS, OpenAI's GPT-4 leads the pack, followed closely by Google's Gemini models, Mistral's Medium model, and Anthropic's Claude.

Notably, Mistral's newest LLM, Mistral Large, has achieved impressive results across various benchmarks, rivaling GPT 3.5. This model is now available through Mistral's API and Microsoft Azure, marking a significant milestone in the collaboration between Mistral and Microsoft.

The partnership, announced in February 2024, does not grant Microsoft exclusive rights or control over Mistral, allowing the startup to maintain its independence. This development highlights the growing importance of strategic partnerships in the AI ecosystem.
